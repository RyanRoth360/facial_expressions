# facial_expressions
Image database is forked from facial_expressions repository for training the model. All python files were uploaded by me personally. 

# Structure
There are two directories. The `images` directory contains raw images. These
are unprocessed. The `data` directory contains files specific to training.
Most importantly, this includes the `legend.csv`, which maps an image in the
`images` directory with a facial expression. 

This file also has a user ID field. Please use something unique.
It is primarily for tracking which students added which files.
The IDs can be used for a secondary analysis to determine
whether there are any patterns to the submissions.
